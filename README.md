## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I did not use any outside resources.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[A challenge that I encountered was when working on the functionality of the guessing part of the game. I tried to tackle
this part of the game myself; however, I had trouble getting the functionality to work as expected. I used the
hints and examples provided in the prework instructions to help walk me through the steps.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I am curious to explore all the different libraries that are available to creating web projects
and applications.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would add more features to enhance the look of this game. I would create some kind of a theme
to make this game look even more professional and use sounds that match the theme accordingly. I 
would also create a "how-to play" page for this game.]
